I program computers, ride bikes, and play folk music in Colorado. I love studying the history of technology and how it influences, interacts with, and is a part of culture. My primary interests are in data science for many different fields, especially dealing with large unstructured datasets, scalable ETL automation, and data visualization for improving narratives and understanding. Musically, my focus is on traditional Celtic guitar, but I also play banjo, mandolin, and a few other stringed things. I also produce electronic music, and really enjoy recording and mixing home studio recording and live sound.
