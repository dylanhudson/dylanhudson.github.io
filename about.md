thanks for reading! these are my attempts to provide important historical
context and frameworks for critical thinking about current events. synthesis and learning are evolving challenges in the age of information and data, and I hope to share some of the tools I use to make sense from the constant noise and implement the self-curiosity needed to maintain a truly open mind.

about me:
I program computers, ride bikes, and play folk music in Colorado. I love history and classics, data science, and discovering new artists. I hope to further study and train in data science and public health to work on building functional information infrastructure and policy with informed regard to improving lives through health, civil rights, and educated democracy.
